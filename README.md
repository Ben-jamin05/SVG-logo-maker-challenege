# README Generator challenge

## Description

My motivation for this project was to make a SVG logo generator. This consists of using inquirer to collect user data for the text content, color and shape of the logo. I got the user input in a userIn.js file and then got the shape class corresponding to the user input form the shapes.js file. The data is then used to create the shape with the user specifications and then written to a SVG file names logo.svg. The shapes have a test file to make sure that the are the proper shapes with the correct properties. I accomplished this with my skills in js and my knew knowledge of inquirer, fs and svg. 

## Installation

You will need to use node.js. Once installed type 'npm init' and 'npm i inquirer@8.2.4' and 'npm i jest' into the integrated terminal to install the content and testing needed for this program.

## Usage

To use this program in the same integrated terminal as used before type 'node index.js' to run the program.
This [video]() has a more indepth walkthrough of the program.
